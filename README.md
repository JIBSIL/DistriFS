# DistriFS: efficient, secure, decentralized filesystem

[![status](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/af09fee13984aa8fc8dc2c5cf062756e/status.svg)](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/af09fee13984aa8fc8dc2c5cf062756e)

DistriFS is a filesystem allowing for decentralized access to files of your choice through a file network. It is comparable to torrenting, IPFS and Storj. An indexer-server approach is used for security and speed. You may learn more about precisely how the software works in the "Academic Paper" section or by reading the respective README.md files in the sub-folders.

# Running a Node
Participating in the DistriFS network is easy! Releases are built every minor version in Github Releases for Windows, macOS and Linux. Configure and run a server, then register it on the official indexer to start. If you want to run your own indexer, those programs are also available.

More information is available in the server folder's README.md

# Docker
Docker support is currently coming soon. A Dockerfile will be provided shortly for both the indexer and server.

# Academic Paper
This work is part of academic research titled "DistriFS: A Platform and User Agnostic Approach to File Distribution". It is posted on arXiv and will also be added to PAPER.md

# Benchmarks
Coming soon!
